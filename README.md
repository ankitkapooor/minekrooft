# minekrooft
This is an extremely basic and non-functional instance of the popular game Minecraft which I coded in Python using the Ursina Library. It has a few basic functionalities like placing a block, destroying a block, and 4 different block types (brick, dirt, wood and grass). Unlike the original game, minekrooft doesn't have inventory features or a designed gameplay. It is a simple attempt at mimicking the blocky structure of Minecraft and helps providing a basic understanding of how the original game was made.
